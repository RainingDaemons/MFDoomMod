# MF Doom Mod for Necesse
This is the source code of the MF Doom Mod for the Necesse game.

Created by RainingDaemons & SpaceHand.

# Features
A fun little mod that introduces the following objects to the game Necesse:
* **New Cosmetics:** you can now use the classic MF Doom costume based on the ReAction Figures figure.
* **New Meals:** A MF Doom mod can't be perfect, if it doesn't have the legendary recipe of MF Doom's Villainous Mac & Cheeze that's why now this recipe is available as a consumable meal.
* **New Music:** New music vinyls were also added, at the moment the song "Rapp Snitch Knishes" is available.
